# Learning Postman

Sometimes we use something without understand how that "thing" can really help us. In other case we really won't use fully because that is a swiss knife and some features just don't matter in our context and thats ok.

Postman is a swiss knife in my opinion and I'll wont use all features. But is good explore some.

I'll use a step by step approach using Postman basic feature and going to some more advanced.

Tip: update Postman to newest version clicking on `Help` -> `Check for updates` on left top Postman menu. This docs are based on Postman 10.18.2 version features.
