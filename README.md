# Learning Postman

Sometimes we use something without understand how that "thing" can really help us. In other case we really won't use it fully because some features just don't matter in our context and thats ok.

Postman is a swiss knife in my opinion and I'll wont use all features. But is good explore some of them.

I'll use a step by step approach to explore Postman basic feature and going to some more advanced.

Tip: update Postman to latest version clicking on `Help` -> `Check for updates` on left top Postman menu. This docs are based on Postman 10.18.2 version features.
